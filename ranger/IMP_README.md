# NOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

* In curr dir:
    * `kdialog` - default kdialog executable while installing KDE env for file pickers (mainly for chrome/brave/edge, firefox is prolly different)
    * `modded_kdialog` - place this @/usr/local/bin/kdialog to override default exec (@/usr/bin/kdialog), and this will invoke our ranger instead
