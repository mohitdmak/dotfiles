# When in visual mode, "O" and "o" both switch between the starting and ending of the code selected.

# When inside a closed block of text (i.e, content between "" or '' or () or {} or [] or <>, etc); 
    # "i" in visual mode selects text until the outer covering character
    # EG: vi" in the text: ""mohit makwana"" : with cursor@t selects: mohit makwana
    # EG: 2vi" or va" in the same above case elects: "mohit makwana"
    # EG: 2va" in the same above case selects: ""mohit makwana""

# Also use substitution more frequently
    # In 1 line in 1st occurence:                  :s/old/new
    # In 1 line for all occurences:                :s/old/new/g
    # Change every occurences between 2 line no.s: :#,#s/old/new/g
    # Change every occurence in whole file:        :%s/old/new/g
    # Same as above + prompt asking for each:      :%s/old/new/gc
